MAKING AND INSTALLING THE DISTRIBUTION

    You should be able to make and install the distribution with a pretty
    standard default configuration by typing the following commands

	% ./configure --help
		This will list the available options.
		The configure script will also use your environmental
		variables for determining compiler/linker options.
		These environment variables are used:
			CC			C compiler	(cc, ecgs)
			CFLAGS		C Flags		(-ansi)
			CPPFLAGS	CPP Flags	(-I -D)
			LDFLAGS		LDFLAGS		(-L -l)

	% [env settings] ./configure [options]
		this will configure the build system

	% make depend
		this will create dependency information

	% make 
		this will build the system

	% su
	# make install

    in this directory.  This should produce something that basically
    works.

    You will probably want to do a little configuration to suit your
    site, though.  There are one file you might want to edit:

	include/ldapconfig.h.edit
		This file contains #defines used by many parts of the
		distribution.  You'll at least want to change DEFAULT_BASE.

    See the INSTALL file in this directory for more information.

    routines in the various libraries.  See ldap(3) for details.
