OpenLDAP Devel README
	OpenLDAP -devel is for the development of OpenLDAP.  As such,
	it changes often.  These changes include changes in functionality
	and unproven bug fixes.  Many of these changes will cause
	previous working programs to fail.

	Additional developer documents are available in doc/devel,
		todo list
		guidelines for developers

	Client developers seeking a stable development platform
	should use -stable.

REQUIRED SOFTWARE
	Build OpenLDAP requires the following software components:

	Base system (libraries and tools):
		Standard C compiler, headers, and libraries
		POSIX REGEX headers and libraries

	SLAPD:
		LDBM compatible datastore
			(Berkeley DB, Sleepycat DB2, or GDBM)

	SLURPD:
		LTHREAD compatible thread package
			(POSIX pthreads, MIT pthreads, Mach Cthreads or Sun LWP)

	LDAPD:
		ISODE compatible X.500 distribution

	CLIENTS/CONTRIB ware:
		Depends on package.  See per package README.
		

MAKING AND INSTALLING THE DISTRIBUTION
	This is a quick guide.  For details, see the INSTALL file.

	% ./configure
		autoconf OpenLDAP for current platform

	% make depend
		this will create dependency information

	% make 
		this will build the system

	% su
	# make install

    in this directory.  This should produce something that basically
    works.  You can "cd tests; make" to verify the build.

    You will probably want to do a little configuration to suit your
    site, though.  There are one file you might want to edit:

	include/ldapconfig.h.edit
		This file contains #defines used by many parts of the
		distribution.  You'll at least want to change DEFAULT_BASE.

    See the INSTALL file in this directory for more information.

    routines in the various libraries.  See ldap(3) for details.
