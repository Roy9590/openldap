REQUIRED SOFTWARE
	Build OpenLDAP requires the following software components:

	Base system (libraries and tools):
		Standard C compiler, headers, and libraries
		POSIX REGEX headers and libraries

	SLAPD:
		LDBM compatible datastore
			(Berkeley DB, Sleepycat DB2, or GDBM)
	SLURPD:
		LTHREAD compatible thread package
			(POSIX pthreads, MIT pthreads, Mach Cthreads or Sun LWP)

	LDAPD:
		ISODE compatible ldap distribution

	CLIENTS/CONTRIBware:
		Depends on package.  See per package READMEs.
		

MAKING AND INSTALLING THE DISTRIBUTION

    You should be able to make and install the distribution with a
    default configuration by typing the following commands:

	% ./configure --help
		This will list the available options.
		The configure script will also use your environmental
		variables for determining compiler/linker options.
		These environment variables are used:
			CC			C compiler	(cc, ecgs)
			CFLAGS		C Flags		(-ansi)
			CPPFLAGS	CPP Flags	(-I -D)
			LDFLAGS		LDFLAGS		(-L -l)

	% [env settings] ./configure [options]
		this will configure the build system

	% make depend
		this will create dependency information

	% make 
		this will build the system

	% su
	# make install

    in this directory.  This should produce something that basically
    works.  You can "cd tests; make" to verify the build.

    You will probably want to do a little configuration to suit your
    site, though.  There are one file you might want to edit:

	include/ldapconfig.h.edit
		This file contains #defines used by many parts of the
		distribution.  You'll at least want to change DEFAULT_BASE.

    See the INSTALL file in this directory for more information.

DOCUMENTATION

    There are man pages for most programs in the distribution and
    routines in the various libraries.  See ldap(3) for details.

    There is an OpenLDAP homepage available that contains the latest
    LDAP news, releases announcements, pointers to other LDAP resources,
    etc. You can access it at this URL:
