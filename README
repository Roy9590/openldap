UM-LDAP 3.3 README file

    This is the UM-LDAP version 3.3 distribution.  For a description of
    what this distribution contains, see the ANNOUNCEMENT file in this
    directory.  For a description of changes from previous releases,
    see the CHANGES file in this directory.  For a more detailed
    description of how to make and install the distribution, see the
    INSTALL file in this directory.  For more information on making and
    installing slapd, see the "SLAPD and SLURPD Administrator's Guide"
    in the doc/guides/ directory.

MAKING AND INSTALLING THE DISTRIBUTION

    You should be able to make and install the distribution with a pretty
    standard default configuration by typing the following commands

	% make
	% su
	# make install

    in this directory.  This should produce something that basically
    works.

    You will probably want to do a little configuration to suit your
    site, though.  There are two files you might want to edit:

	Make-common		   This file contains definitions for
				   where things will be installed, where
				   to find various things, etc.  If you
				   want to build an ldap server, you'll
				   definitely need to edit this file

	include/ldapconfig.h.edit  This file contains #defines used
				   by many parts of the distribution.
				   You'll at least want to change
				   DEFAULT_BASE.

    See the INSTALL file in this directory for more information.

DOCUMENTATION

    There are man pages for most programs in the distribution and
    routines in the various libraries.  See ldap(3) for details.

    There is a postscript version of an administrator's guide for
    slapd in doc/guides/slapd.ps.

    There is an LDAP homepage available that contains the latest
    LDAP news, releases announcements, pointers to other LDAP resources,
    etc. You can access it at this URL:
