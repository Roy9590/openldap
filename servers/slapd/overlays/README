# $OpenLDAP$

This directory is still a work in progress. As such, no explicit makefile
is provided.

The overlays are meant to be built as dynamically loaded modules.
To build a particular overlay, use commands of this form:

	libtool --mode=compile cc -I../../../include -I.. -c dyngroup.c
	libtool --mode=link cc -rpath /module/executable/path \
		-module -o dyngroup.la dyngroup.lo

To use the dyngroup overlay on a backend, set slapd.conf as follows:

	moduleload /module/executable/path/dyngroup.la

	database bdb
	... (BDB configuration)
	overlay dyngroup
	attrpair member memberurl

Replace "/module/executable/path" with the full pathname of the directory
where the module will be installed.
