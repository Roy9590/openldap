* Short term:

- add missing functions (FIXED)

- review per-target error handling

- dn cache and cache exploitation to refine the candidate selection (?) (FIXED)

- review the group and attribute stuff (also in back-ldap!) (FIXED, need to
  test attribute)

- rework compare and bind to attempt to operate on all candidate entries
  while checking at most one succeedes

- clear previously bound targets when the bind is repeated

* Long term:

- distributed entries
