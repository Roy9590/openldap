back-monitor

Backend for monitoring the server's activity.  It must be explicitly
enabled by configuring with `--enable-monitor' set; then it must be
activated by placing in slapd.conf the configure directive

database	monitor

The suffix "cn=Monitor" is implicitly activated (it cannot be given
as a suffix of the database as usually done for conventional backends).

The backend root is "cn=Monitor"; the first level entries represent
the monitored subsystems.  It is being implemented in a modular way,
to ease the addition of new subsystems.
All the subsystems get a default "cn" attribute, represented by the
subsystem's name, and they all have "top", "LDAPsubEntry" and
"monitorSubEntry" objectclasses (the latter has not been defined yet,
pending the design of the monitor schema and its registration under
OpenLDAP's OID).
Most of the sybsystems contain an additional depth level, represented
by detailed item monitoring.
All the entries undergo an update operation, if a related method is
defined, prior to being returned.  Moreover, there's a mechanism to
allow volatile entries to be defined, and generated on the fly when
requested.  As an instance, the connection statistics are updated
at each request, while each active connection data is created on the
fly.

This document is in a very early stage of maturity and will probably 
be rewritten many times before the monitor backend is released.
