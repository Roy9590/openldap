			       LDAP 3.3

    The University of Michigan is pleased to announce release 3.3 of
    UM-LDAP, an implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access
    Protocol. LDAP is a draft Internet standard directory service
    protocol that runs over TCP/IP. It can be used to provide a
    stand-alone directory service, or to provide lightweight access to
    the X.500 directory.  LDAP is defined by RFC 1777 and RFC 1778.

    This release includes the following components:

	- slapd - a stand-alone LDAP directory server
	- slurpd - a stand-alone LDAP replication server
	- ldapd - an LDAP-to-X.500 gateway server
	- centipede - an LDAP centroid generation and maintenance program
	- libldap - an LDAP client library
	- liblber - a lightweight BER/DER encoding/decoding library
	- ldif tools - data conversion tools for use with slapd
	- in.xfingerd - a finger-to-LDAP gateway server
	- go500 - a gopher-to-LDAP gateway server for searching
	- go500gw - a gopher-to-LDAP gateway server for searching and browsing
	- rcpt500 - an email-to-LDAP query responder
	- mail500 - an LDAP-capable mailer
	- fax500 - an LDAP-capable mailer that supports remote printing
	- LDAP tools - A collection of shell-based LDAP utility programs

    In addition, there are some contributed components:

	- web500 - an HTTP-to-LDAP gateway
	- whois++d - a WHOIS++-to-LDAP gateway
	- saucer - a simple command-line oriented client program
