# $OpenLDAP$

This directory contains slapd overlays specific to samba4 LDAP backend:

	- rdnval


  - RDNVAL

This overlay maintains the operational attribute "rdnValue".  It contains
the value of the entry's RDN.  This attribute is defined by the overlay
itself as

	( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.1.58
		NAME 'rdnValue'
		DESC 'the value of the naming attributes'
		SYNTAX '1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15'
		EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
		USAGE dSAOperation
		NO-USER-MODIFICATION )

under OpenLDAP's development OID arc.  This OID is temporary.

To use the overlay, add:

	moduleload <path to>rdnval.so
	...

	database <whatever>
	...
	overlay rdnval

to your slapd configuration file.  An instance is required for each database
that needs to maintain this attribute.

This overlay is only set up to be built as a dynamically loaded module.
On most platforms, in order for the module to be usable, all of the 
library dependencies must also be available as shared libraries.

If you need to build the overlay statically, you will have to move it into the
slapd/overlays directory and edit the Makefile and overlays.c to reference
it. You will also have to define SLAPD_OVER_SMBK5PWD to SLAPD_MOD_STATIC,
and add the relevant libraries to the main slapd link command.
