This directory contains a set of files that build a simple LDAP client
program.  The program is command-line oriented and uses a syntax and
command set roughly similar to ISODE's DISH program, hence it is
named "saucer" (i.e. a very small "dish" :-)

To build saucer, make sure the top-level LDAP 'make' has created all
of the makefiles from their templates (you can force this by typing
"make makefiles" in the LDAP root directory).  Then cd into
contrib/saucer and type make.  With luck, saucer will compile and
link without any warnings or errors.  You can then install it by
doing an "su" and typing "make install".  This will copy the binary
to the directory you specified for LDAP binaries, and the man page
will be placed in the appropriate man directory.

Saucer runs from the Unix command line with the following arguments:

  saucer [-h host] [-p portnumber] [-u X500UserName]
         [-c credentials] [-d debug-level]

If no options are given, saucer will attempt to connect to an LDAP
daemon on the local host and default port (389), and will attempt to
bind anonymously.

Typing "help" at saucer's command prompt will yield:

Cmd? help
Supported commands are:
  help
  list
  moveto
  quit
  search
  set
  show

You can get syntactical help for a command by typing "help <command>".
Detailed instructions are available from the saucer man page.
