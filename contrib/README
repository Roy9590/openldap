LDAP contrib README

Contributed code lives underneath this contrib directory.  It is not as
well-integrated into the LDAP build process as the rest of the LDAP
distribution.  Please see the README files in each contrib subdirectory
for build instructions.

Current contributions:

    saucer	General purpose command-line LDAP client, modeled
		after ISODE's DISH (DIrectory SHell) client.
		Contributed by Eric Rosenquist.  See saucer/README
		and its man page for more information.

    web500gw	HTTP gateway for X.500, modeled after go500gw.
		Contributed by Frank Richter.  See web500gw/README
		for more information.

    whois++	WHOIS++ gateway to X.500.  Contributed by Mark Prior.
