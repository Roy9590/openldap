OpenLDAP Contributed Software README

OpenLDAP provides a number of freely-distributable LDAP software
packages.  Though distributed with OpenLDAP, they are not part of
OpenLDAP.  Some packages may be out of date.  Each package in
this directory has it's own use and redistribution restrictions
as documented within the package.
