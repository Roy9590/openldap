IMPORTANT HINT FOR UPGRADING TO VERSION 2.3.x:

    the config-syntax of ALLOW-STRING DENY-STRING GRANT REFUSE has changed:
    now regular expressions are used enabling shorter config strings.

    the language-files have been extended. Please use the newly provided
    language-files or update your old ones.



INTRODUCTION

   TWEB is based on the Web500gw implementation by Frank Richter, 
   Technische Universitaet Chemnitz-Zwickau, which is based on the 
   go500gw implementation by Tim Howes, University of Michigan.

   TWEB was compiled and tested on LINUX with cc, HPUX 9.05 with the
   HP-ANSI C compiler, as well as SunOS 4.1.2 with the SUN C compiler.
   TWEB was also compiled with gcc on all platforms.

   The UMICH LDAP client library version 3.0 or 3.3
   ( URL:ftp://terminator.rs.itd.umich.edu/ldap/ldap-3.3.tar.Z )
   must be installed on the machine (library path and include file 
   path is configured in Makefile). With QUIPU ICR-2.x the ISODE-
   provided LDAP libraries should be used. As such, TWEB only supports
   LDAP version 2 with the University of Michigan type C API. TWEB is
   also adapted for the OpenLDAP LDAP library, release version 1.1.2
   (http://www.openldap.org).

   An upgrade to LDAP version 3 and a C API standadized by the IETF
   is planned for a not so far away future, most probably in step 
   with the OpenLDAP package.

   TWEB, as provided here is a fully functional core gateway, which
   is extended at the author's site by some local features. These
   extensions are included into the same code base, so that some
   "#ifdef TUE_TEL" or "#ifdef AMBIX" pre-processor statements can
   be found throughout the code. 

   Have a look at the doc sub-directory to get some further documentation.


INSTALLATION

   The installation and configuration of TWEB is described in the
   GETTING-STARTED file. After making and testing the basic TWEB
   you should have a look to file FEATURE-LIST to learn about the 
   several configuration parameters TWEB provides for runtime
   configuration of the program.
