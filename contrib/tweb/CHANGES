        SORT definitions given by config files can be changed due to
        local information within a DIT area; that provides for dynamic
        definitions of sorting groups and/or display of groups with new
        labels and/or other sorting order;
        DISPLAY definitions can be replaced or added dynamically, in order
        to display contents of entries in other than the statically
        configured way
