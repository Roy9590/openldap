ChangeLog for gtk-tool

26/11/1998 - Pele
	* Added nice icons in the browser pane - looks decent now.
	* Fixed scrolling in the data (right) pane - now scrolls if there is
	a long tab
	* removed class My_Scroller
	* removed file Gtk_LdapItem.cc (useless)
	* commented-out the part where data gets reused instead of re-querying
	the server, stupid I know, but for the time being if resolves some
	problems with replacement of right pane.
	* Misc. fixes

26/11/1998 - Pele
	* First appearance of ChangeLog
	* Fixed removal of scrolled window on the right hand side
