ChangeLog for gtk-tool

28/11/1998 - Pele
	* Fixes, enhancements, started using ldap utility api
	* It now traverses the whole tree at startup, not sure if it's smart
	but I did it because of something that has no relevance to network
	traffic

27/11/1998 - Pele
	* Added viewports, both sides now scroll automatically
	* Brought back the "cache" stuff, now data gets reused if it's allready
	available without redundant searches/listings.
	* Editing pixmaps by hand is so much, er, fun!
	* Miniscule fixes

26/11/1998 - Pele
	* Added nice icons in the browser pane - looks decent now.
	* Fixed scrolling in the data (right) pane - now scrolls if there is
	a long tab
	* removed class My_Scroller
	* removed file Gtk_LdapItem.cc (useless)
	* commented-out the part where data gets reused instead of re-querying
	the server, stupid I know, but for the time being if resolves some
	problems with replacement of right pane.
	* Misc. fixes

26/11/1998 - Pele
	* First appearance of ChangeLog
	* Fixed removal of scrolled window on the right hand side
	  thus making gtk-tool a viable project to be worked on
	* added command-line parameter parsing - now accepts
	  -s for server, -p for port, -b for baseDN
