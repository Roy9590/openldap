LOADS!!!

Please someone test this with old U-MICH API - hopefully all is as it should be.

Odd behaviour with tabbed panes - labels misteriously dissapear after you
select a node for the second time 'round. Anyone any ideas on this?

Priorities:
	Now that we have cn=config we can start using ldap_get_option propperly
	and be able to run/stop server from the gtk-tool. Other things like
	new entries would now come in handy.
	Implement searches
	port to autoconf (anyone? it should be easy)

Optional:
	comments in the source code	
	port it to NT so we can use it with the NT port of OpenLDAP
	(is there a NT port of Gtk+?)
