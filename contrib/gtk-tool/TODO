LOADS!!!

Priorities:
	Make it useful!
	Implement searches
	Some sort of config-file parsing (not new files, but existing
	slapd-config stuff)
	port to autoconf (anyone? it should be easy)

Optional:
	comments in the source code	
	port it to NT so we can use it with the NT port of OpenLDAP
	(is there a NT port of Gtk+?)
