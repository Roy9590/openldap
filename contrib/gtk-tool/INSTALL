Please read this carefully

To copile gtk-tool, although OpenLDAP in itself is a very out-of-the-box 
straightforward piece of code to compile gtk-tool isn't. You will require the
latest Gtk+/Gtk-- CVS trees on your machine - as of 11 February 1999 so your 
last weeks' checkout is more than likely allready useless - not my problem, they
promise API freezes and then don't stick to it...what can I say...a hint for
the gtk people - Java 1.1

So, latest gtk stuff and if you successfully compiled and installed all that it should be easy. If you didn't I really hope you can take some comfort in that I have provided you with some snapshots of what the thing actually looks like. I hope in the near future I would be able to provide you with a static binary..next week perhaps..I don't know, I'm looking for a job right now so no promises...
