README for gtk-tool v0.6

This package has been tested and run with the latest Gtk+/Gtk--
OpenLDAP 1.1-devel. This thing doesn't run as it should, please
read TODO!

Just type 'make' to compile and if you have all the necessary stuff it'll do so.
You do need the latest version of Gtk+ and Gtk-- (which may be tricky to build).
You can also edit the Makefile and under "OPTS=-g" add " -DDEBUG" (line should
read "OPTS=-g -DDEBUG") to get a trace of what the gtk-tool is doing (getting
entries, traversing trees etc...)
After that, hopefully all goes well, you start the thing by doing:
./main -s localhost

It no longer has a default base, instead it reads cn=config off your slapd
and accordignly inserts all available databases under "localhost". If you are
not running slapd on your local machine, then supply it with a "-s hostname"
i.e.:
	./main -s server02.nowhere.net

It does not accept -b switch as it no longer needs it to aquire databases.
But please feel free to add whatever else you consider neccessary to 
understanding how this thing works. Enjoy, and I hope this can be useful to 
you in some miniscule way.

All emails to -devel list, and plase make sure you put "GTK-TOOL"
in the subject line, so other people who are not interested don't
have to read our garbage.
