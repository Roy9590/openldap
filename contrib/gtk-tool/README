This is the first version of this README
gtk-tool v0.5delta

This package has been tested and run with the latest Gtk+/Gtk--
OpenLDAP 1.1-devel. This thing doesn't run as it should, please
read TODO!

I really couldn't think of anything else to put here (at the moment
that is). But please feel free to add whatever else you consider
neccessary to understanding how this thing works. Enjoy, and I hope
this can be useful to you in some miniscule way.
