README for gtk-tool v0.6

This package has been tested and run with the latest Gtk+/Gtk--
OpenLDAP 1.1-devel. This thing doesn't run as it should, please
read TODO!

Just type 'make' to compile and if you have all the necessary stuff it'll do so.
You do need the latest version of Gtk+ and Gtk-- (which may be tricky to build).
After that, hopefully all goes well, you start the thing by doing:
./main

It will default to base of o=University of Michigan, c=US", localhost, and 
LDAP_PORT (389). This is because OpenLDAP comes with the UMICH ldif and the 
assumption is that many of you have actually created a test db with that data 
(to see that people don't lie when they say OpenLDAP actually works or 
something). If you want to change any of these do ./main -h and it will give 
you a list of supported parameters. 

In short this is what you can do:

./main -h ldap-server.somewhere.net -p 28345 -b "o=OpenLDAP Foundation, c=US"

I really couldn't think of anything else to put here (at the moment
that is). But please feel free to add whatever else you consider
neccessary to understanding how this thing works. Enjoy, and I hope
this can be useful to you in some miniscule way.

All emails to -devel list, and plase make sure you put "GTK-TOOL"
in the subject line, so other people who are not interested don't
have to read our garbage.
