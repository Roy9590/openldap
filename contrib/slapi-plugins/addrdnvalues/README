This directory contains a SLAPI plugin, addrdnvalues, which will add to
an entry any attribute values that appear in the entry's RDN but not in
the entry. This is necessary for compliance with some "broken" clients.

No Makefile is provided. Use a command line similar to:

gcc -shared -I../../../include -Wall -g -o libaddrdnvalues-plugin.so addrdnvalues.c

to compile this plugin.
