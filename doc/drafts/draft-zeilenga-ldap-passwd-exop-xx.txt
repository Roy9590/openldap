2.      Abstract

  The integration of LDAP and external authentication services has
  introduced non-DN authentication identities and allowed for
  non-directory storage of passwords.   As such, mechanisms which update
  the directory (e.g. Modify) cannot be used to change a user's
  password.  This document describes an LDAP extended operation to allow
  modification of user passwords which is not dependent upon the form of
  the authentication identity nor the password storage mechanism used.

  The key words ``MUST'', ``MUST NOT'', ``REQUIRED'', ``SHALL'', ``SHALL
  NOT'', ``SHOULD'', ``SHOULD NOT'', ``RECOMMENDED'',  and ``MAY'' in
  this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
  [RFC2119].


3.      Background and Intent of Use

  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [RFC2251] is designed to
  support an number of authentication mechanisms including simple user
  name/password pairs.  Traditionally LDAP users where identified by the
  Distinguished Name [RFC2253] of a directory entry and this entry
  contained a userPassword [RFC2256] attribute containing one or more
  passwords.

  The protocol does not mandate that passwords associated with a user be
  stored in the directory server.  The server may use any attribute
  suitable for password storage (e.g. userPassword), or use
  non-directory storage.

  The integration [RFC2829] of application neutral SASL [RFC2222]
  services which support simple username/password mechanisms (such as
  DIGEST-MD5) has introduced non-LDAP DN authentication identity forms
  and made storage of passwords the responsibility of the SASL service
  provider.

  LDAP update operations are designed to act upon attributes of an entry
  within the directory.  LDAP update operations cannot be used to modify
  a user's password when the user is not represented by a DN, does not
  have a entry, or when that password used by the server is not stored
  as an attribute of an entry.  An alternative mechanism is needed.

  This document describes an LDAP Extended Operation intended to allow
  directory clients to update user passwords.  The user may or may not
  be associated with a directory entry. The user may or may not be
  represented as an LDAP DN.  The user's password may or may not be
  stored in the directory.

  The operation SHOULD NOT be used without adequate security protection
  as the operation affords no privacy or integrity protect itself.  This
  operation SHALL NOT be used anonymously.


4.      Password Modify Request and Response

  The Password Modify operation is an LDAPv3 Extended Operation
  [RFC2251, Section 4.12] and is identified by the OBJECT IDENTIFIER
  passwdModifyOID.  This section details the syntax of the protocol

INTERNET-DRAFT     draft-zeilenga-ldap-passwd-exop-05   3 Novemeber 2000


  request and response.

    passwdModifyOID OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.11.1

    PasswdModifyRequestValue ::= SEQUENCE {
      userIdentity    [0]  OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
      oldPasswd       [1]  OCTET STRING OPTIONAL
      newPasswd       [2]  OCTET STRING OPTIONAL }

    PasswdModifyResponseValue ::= SEQUENCE {
      genPasswd       [0]     OCTET STRING OPTIONAL }


4.1.    Password Modify Request

  A Password Modify request is an ExtendedRequest with the requestName
  field containing passwdModifyOID OID and optionally provides a
  requestValue field.  If the requestValue field is provided, it SHALL
  contain a PasswdModifyRequestValue with one or more fields present.

  The userIdentity field, if present, SHALL contain an octet string
  representation of the user associated with the request.  This string
  may or may not be an LDAPDN [RFC2253].  If no userIdentity field is
  present, the request acts up upon the password of the user currently
  associated with the LDAP session.

  The oldPasswd field, if present, SHALL contain the user's current
  password.

  The newPasswd field, if present, SHALL contain the desired password
  for this user.


4.2.    Password Modify Response

  A Password Modify response is an ExtendedResponse where the
  responseName field is absent and the response field is optional.  The
  response field, if present, SHALL contain a PasswdModifyResponseValue
  with genPasswd field present.

  The genPasswd field, if present, SHALL contain a generated password
  for the user.

  If an resultCode other than success (0) is indicated in the response,
  the response field MUST be absent.


5.      Operation Requirements

INTERNET-DRAFT     draft-zeilenga-ldap-passwd-exop-05   3 Novemeber 2000


  Clients SHOULD NOT submit a Password Modification request without
  ensuring adequate security safeguards are in place.  Servers SHOULD
  return a non-success resultCode if sufficient security protection are
  not in place.

  Servers SHOULD indicate their support for this extended operation by
  providing PasswdModifyOID as a value of the supportedExtension
  attribute type in their root DSE.  A server MAY choose to advertise
  this extension only when the client is authorized and/or has
  established the necessary security protections to use this operation.
  Clients SHOULD verify the server implements this extended operation
  prior to attempting the operation by asserting the supportedExtension
  attribute contains a value of PasswdModifyOID.

  The server SHALL only return success upon successfully changing the
  user's password.  The server SHALL leave the password unmodified and
  return a non-success resultCode otherwise.

  If the server does not recognize provided fields or does not support
  the combination of fields provided, it SHALL NOT change the user
  password.

  If oldPasswd is present and the provided value cannot be verified or
  is incorrect, the server SHALL NOT change the user password.  If
  oldPasswd is not present, the server MAY use other policy to determine
  whether or not to change the password.

  The server SHALL NOT generate a password on behalf of the client if
  the client has provided a newPasswd.  In absence of a client provided
  newPasswd, the server SHALL either generate a password on behalf of
  the client or return a non-success result code.  The server MUST
  provide the generated password upon success as the value of the
  genPasswd field.

  The server MAY return adminLimitExceeded, busy,
  confidentialityRequired, operationsError, unavailable,
  unwillingToPerform, or other non-success resultCode as appropriate to
  indicate that it was unable to successfully complete the operation.

  Servers MAY implement administrative policies which restrict this
  operation.


6.      Security Considerations

  This operation is used to modify user passwords.  The operation itself
  does not provide any security protection to ensure integrity and/or
  confidentiality of the information.  Use of this operation is strongly



Zeilenga                                                        [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT     draft-zeilenga-ldap-passwd-exop-05   3 Novemeber 2000


  discouraged when privacy protections are not in place to guarantee
  confidentiality and may result in the disclosure of the password to
  unauthorized parties.  Use of Start TLS [RFC 2830] is highly
  recommended.
