BeOS Hints

Latest: http://www.openldap.org/faq/index.cgi?file=96

OpenLDAP has been tested with BeOS R4 x86 using GDBM (downloadable from a
geekgadgets mirror). All tools, daemons and libraries build and work,
however the BeOS threads are not yet supported.

Help with thread support and testing on PPC is appreciated (and needed).
