Sun Solaris Hints

** This file covers Solaris 2 and later releases.  **
** Solaris 1.X is covered in the SunOS hints file. **


Solaris 2.6, pthread_create() in -lc

The Standard C library (-lc) contains pthread functions which
are not compatible with <pthread.h> and are not useable.  The
autoconf system does not detect this incompatibility nor
attempts to resolve it.  Consequently, slapd/slurpd will not
work correctly using out-of-the-box settings.  Slapd will
report an error such as:
	listener pthread_create failed

To resolve this problem, the installer must specify the
proper Pthreads libraries:
	LIBS="-lpthread -lposix4"
	./configure

OR use Solaris (LWP) Threads
	./configure --with-threads=lwp

OR disable threads: 
	./configure --without-threads


NDBM on Solaris

Solaris NDBM and OpenLDAP appears to be incompatible.  Use
GDBM or Berkeley DB2.
