Sun Solaris Hints

** This file covers Solaris 2 and later releases.  **
** Solaris 1.X is covered in the SunOS hints file. **


Solaris 2.6, pthread_create() in -lc

The Standard C library (-lc) contains pthread functions which
are not compatible with <pthread.h> and are not useable.  The
autoconf system will detect this incompatibility but does not
attempts to resolve it.  configure will exit using
out-of-the-box settings with the error:
  checking if pthread_create() works... no
  configure: error: pthread.h and pthread_create are not compatible

To resolve this problem, the installer must specify the
proper Pthreads libraries:
  LIBS="-lpthread -lposix4"
  ./configure

OR use Solaris (LWP) Threads
  ./configure --with-threads=lwp

OR disable threads: 
  ./configure --without-threads


NDBM on Solaris

Solaris NDBM and OpenLDAP appears to be incompatible.  Use
Berkeley DB2 or GDBM.
