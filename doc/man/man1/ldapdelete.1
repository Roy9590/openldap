.SH DESCRIPTION
.I ldapdelete
is a shell-accessible interface to the
.BR ldap_delete (3)
library call.
.LP
.B ldapdelete
opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and deletes one or more
entries.  If one or more \fIdn\fP arguments are provided, entries with
those Distinguished Names are deleted.  Each \fIdn\fP should be a
string-represented DN as defined in RFC 1779.  If no \fIdn\fP arguments
are provided, a list of DNs is read from standard input (or from
\fIfile\fP if the -f flag is used).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-n
Show what would be done, but don't actually delete entries.  Useful for
debugging in conjunction with -v.
.TP
.B \-v
Use verbose mode, with many diagnostics written to standard output.
.TP
.B \-k
Use Kerberos authentication instead of simple authentication.  It is
assumed that you already have a valid ticket granting ticket. This option
only has effect if
. B ldapdelete
is compiled with KERBEROS defined.
.TP
.B \-K
Same as \-k, but only does step 1 of the kerberos bind.  This is useful
when connecting to a slapd and there is no x500dsa.hostname principal
registered with your kerberos servers.
.TP
.B \-c
Continuous operation mode.  Errors  are  reported,  but
.B ldapdelete
will  continue  with  deletions.   The default is to exit after
reporting an error.
.TP
.BI \-d \ debuglevel
Set the LDAP debugging level to \fIdebuglevel\fP.
.B ldapdelete
must be compiled with LDAP_DEBUG defined for this option to have any effect.
.TP
.BI \-f \ file
Read a series of lines from \fIfile\fP, performing one LDAP search for
each line.  In this case, the \fIfilter\fP given on the command line
is treated as a pattern where the first occurrence of \fB%s\fP is
replaced with a line from \fIfile\fP.
.TP
.BI \-D \ binddn
Use \fIbinddn\fP to bind to the LDAP directory. \fIbinddn\fP should be
a string-represented DN as defined in RFC 1779.
.TP
.B \-W
Prompt for simple authentication.
This is used instead of specifying the password on the command line.
.TP
.BI \-w \ passwd
Use \fIpasswd\fP as the password for simple authentication.
.TP
.BI \-h \ ldaphost
Specify an alternate host on which the ldap server is running.
.TP
.BI \-p \ ldapport
Specify an alternate TCP port where the ldap server is listening.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following command:
.LP
.nf
    ldapdelete "cn=Delete Me, o=University of Michigan, c=US"
.fi
.LP
will attempt to delete the entry named with commonName "Delete Me"
directly below the University of Michigan organizational entry.  Of
course it would probably be necessary to supply a \fIbinddn\fP and
\fIpasswd\fP for deletion to be allowed (see the -D and -w options).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 if no errors occur.  Errors result in a non-zero exit
status and a diagnostic message being written to standard error.
