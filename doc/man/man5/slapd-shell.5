.SH NAME
slapd-shell \- Shell backend to slapd
.SH SYNOPSIS
ETCDIR/slapd.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Shell backend to
.BR slapd (8)
executes external programs to implement operations, and is designed to
make it easy to tie an existing database to the
.B slapd
front-end.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The
.BR slapd.conf (5)
options in this category apply to the SHELL backend database.
That is, they must follow a "database shell" line and come before any
subsequent "backend" or "database" lines.
.LP
These options specify the pathname of the command to execute in response 
to the given LDAP operation.
Note that you need only supply configuration lines for those commands you
want the backend to handle.
Operations for which a command is not supplied will be refused with an
"unwilling to perform" error.
