.SH NAME
slapo-constraint \- Attribute Constraint Overlay to slapd
.SH SYNOPSIS
ETCDIR/slapd.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
The constraint overlay is used to ensure that attribute values match
some constraints beyond basic LDAP syntax.  Attributes can
have multiple constraints placed upon them, and all must be satisfied
when modifying an attribute value under constraint.
.LP
This overlay is intended to be used to force syntactic regularity upon
certain string represented data which have well known canonical forms,
like telephone numbers, post codes, FQDNs, etc.
.LP
It constrains only LDAP adds and modify commands and only seeks to
control the add and modify value of a modify request.
.SH CONFIGURATION
This
.B slapd.conf
option applies to the constraint overlay.
It should appear after the
.B overlay
directive.
.TP
.B constraint_attribute <attribute_name>[,...] <type> <value>
Specifies the constraint which should apply to the attribute named as
the first parameter.
Two types of constraint are currently supported -
.BR regex ,
.BR size ,
.BR count ,
.BR uri ,
and
.BR set .

The parameter following the
.B regex
type is a Unix style regular expression (See
.BR regex (7)
). The parameter following the
.B uri
type is an LDAP URI. The URI will be evaluated using an internal search.
It must not include a hostname, and it must include a list of attributes
to evaluate.

The parameter following the
.B set
type is a string that is interpreted according to the syntax in use
for ACL sets.  This allows to construct constraints based on the contents
of the entry.

The 
.B size
type can be used to enforce a limit on an attribute length, and the
.B count
type limits the number of values of an attribute.

Any attempt to add or modify an attribute named as part of the
constraint overlay specification which does not fit the 
constraint listed will fail with a
LDAP_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION error.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
.RS
.nf
overlay constraint
constraint_attribute jpegPhoto size 131072
constraint_attribute userPassword count 3
constraint_attribute mail regex ^[:alnum:]+@mydomain.com$
constraint_attribute title uri
  ldap:///dc=catalog,dc=example,dc=com?title?sub?(objectClass=titleCatalog)
constraint_attribute cn,sn,givenName set
  "(this/givenName + [ ] + this/sn) & this/cn"
.fi

.RE
A specification like the above would reject any
.B mail
attribute which did not look like
.BR "<alpha-numeric string>@mydomain.com" .
It would also reject any
.B title
attribute whose values were not listed in the
.B title
attribute of any
.B titleCatalog
entries in the given scope.
Finally, it requires the values of the attribute
.B cn
to be constructed by pairing values of the attributes
.B sn
and 
.BR givenName ,
separated by a space.
