.SH NAME
slapo-glue \- Backend Glue overlay
.SH SYNOPSIS
ETCDIR/slapd.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Backend Glue overlay can be used to glue multiple databases into a
single namingContext. The overlay must be configured on the root database
of the context, and any other databases must be explicitly configured
as subordinates of the root database. All of the participating databases
should have identical rootdns.

All search and write operations will be intercepted by this overlay. Searches
against the root database will be propagated to all the subordinates. Write
operations will pass unaltered to the relevant target database. Note that
any overlays on the root database configured before this overlay will fail
to execute. As such, the glue overlay should always be the first overlay
configured on the root database.

.SH CONFIGURATION
These
.B slapd.conf
options apply to the Backend Glue overlay.
They should appear after the
.B overlay
directive and before any subsequent
.B database
directive.
.TP
.B glue-sub <suffix-DN> [async]
Specify the suffix of a database to attach as a subordinate to the root
database. The specified database must have already been configured. If the
optional "async" keyword is supplied, searches against this database may
be spawned in a separate thread to run concurrently with other operations.
