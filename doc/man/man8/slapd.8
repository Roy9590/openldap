.SH NAME
slapd \- Stand-alone LDAP Daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B LIBEXECDIR/slapd [\-d debug\-level]
.B [\-f slapd\-config\-file] [\-p port\-number]
.B [\-s syslog\-level] [\-i]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B Slapd
is the stand-alone LDAP daemon. It listens for LDAP connections on
port 389, responding
to the LDAP operations it receives over these connections.
.B slapd
is typically invoked at boot time, usually out of
.BR  /etc/rc.local .
Upon startup,
.B slapd
normally forks and disassociates itself from the invoking tty.
If the
.B \-d
flag is given and debugging is set to some non-zero
value,
.B slapd
will not fork and disassociate from the invoking tty.
.LP
.B Slapd
can be configured to provide replicated service for a database with
the help of
.BR slurpd ,
the standalone LDAP update replication daemon.
See
.BR slurpd (8)
for details.
.LP
See "The SLAPD and SLURPD Administrator's Guide" for more details on
.BR slapd .
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-d " debug\-level"
Turn on debugging as defined by
.I debug\-level.
If this option is specified,
.B slapd
will not fork or disassociate from the invoking terminal.  Some general
operation and status messages are printed for any value of \fIdebug\-level\fP.
\fIdebug\-level\fP is taken as a bit string, with each bit corresponding to a
different kind of debugging information.  See <ldap.h> for details.
.TP
.BI \-s " syslog\-level"
This option tells
.B slapd
at what level debugging statements should be logged to the
.BR syslog (8)
facility.
.TP
.BI \-f " slapd\-config\-file"
Specifies the slapd configuration file. The default is
.BR ETCDIR/slapd.conf .
.TP
.BI \-p " port\-number"
.B slapd
will listen on the default LDAP port (389) unless this option is given
to override the default.
.TP
.B \-i
This option tells
.B slapd
that it is being run from
.BR inetd(8) ,
the Internet protocol daemon.
.SH EXAMPLES
To start 
.I slapd
and have it fork and detach from the terminal and start serving
the LDAP databases defined in the default config file, just type:
.LP
.nf
.ft tt
	ETCDIR/slapd
.ft
.fi
.LP
To start 
.B slapd
with an alternate configuration file, and turn
on voluminous debugging which will be printed on standard error, type:
.LP
.nf
.ft tt
	LIBEXECDIR/slapd -f ETCDIR/slapd.conf -d 255
.ft
.fi

When using the LDBM database backend, the Modify RDN operation does not
update the attribute values in the entry that are affected by the change.
