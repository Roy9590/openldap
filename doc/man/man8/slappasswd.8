.SH LIMITATIONS
The practice storing hashed passwords in userPassword
violates Standard Track schema and may hinder
interoperability.  authPassword is not yet widely supported.
.SH "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS"
Use of hashed passwords does not protect passwords during
protocol transfer.  TLS or other eavesdropping protections
should be inplace before using LDAP simple bind.  The
hashed password values should be protected as if they
were clear text passwords.
