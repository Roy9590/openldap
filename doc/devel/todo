OpenLDAP To Do List
-------------------

This is a list of projects that need getting done.  They are defined
by scale of the effort as opposed to priority.  Contribute to projects
based upon your personal priorities.

If you would like to work on any of these projects, please
coordinate with the listed individual.   If no one is
listed, post to OpenLDAP Developer's List (you must be subscribed
to post).

If you have a project you'd like added to the list, talk it up
on Developer's list.
