OpenLDAP To Do List
-------------------

This is a list of projects that need getting done.  They are defined
by scale of the effort as opposed to priority.  Contribute to
projects based upon your personal priorities.

If you would like to work on any of these projects, please coordinate
by posting to OpenLDAP-devel mailing list:
  http://www.OpenLDAP.org/lists

If you have a project you'd like added to the list, talk it up on
Developer's list or just do it.
