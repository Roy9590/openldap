A bug in Sleepycat´s Berkeley DB (version 2.3.16 up to 2.6.4 beta), was
detected, that caused failure during opening of database files when
running a threaded slapd on a linux box.

Apply the supported patch at the root directory of Sleepycat´s code.
Since the bug was reported to Sleepycat, it may not appear in DB
versions, later than 2.6.4 beta.
