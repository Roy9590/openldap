# LDAP has a problem with the idea of implicit vs. explicit yields
# in call conversion threading packages, like the MIT pthreads
# package.  Rather than resolve this globally, I have marked the
# threading as "preeemptive", even though it is technically not.
#
# This means that the implicit-yield threading is topologically
# equivalent to preemptive threading.
